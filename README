This is File::Sort, for sorting files similarly to sort(1).  Written
primarily for MacPerl users who do not have sort(1) and because of memory
limitations cannot sort files in memory, but works on all perls, and can
be useful for portable sorting of large files, or for any system that
doesn't have a sort(1) and is virtual-memory-deprived (including Windows).

See HISTORY in the POD for changes.

Please let me know how well it does(n't) work, and any changes you'd 
like to see.

The sort.pudge program in eg/ does not actually use the File::Sort
module; the actual File::Sort module sources are included in the
program itself, as it is written for distribution with the PPT
project <URL:http://sf.net/projects/ppt/>.
