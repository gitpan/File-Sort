This is File::Sort 0.11, for sorting files similarly to sort(1).  Written
primarily for MacPerl users who do not have sort(1) and because of memory
limitations cannot sort files in memory, but works on all perls.

This archive can always be obtained from:

    http://pudge.net/macperl/
    http://perl.com/CPAN/authors/id/CNANDOR/
    http://perl.com/CPAN/modules/by-module/File/

Mac users: The file is a tarred, gzipped file.  Use Stuffit Expander 
or a similar program to get at the archive.

Please let me know how well it does(n't) work, and any changes you'd 
like to see.
